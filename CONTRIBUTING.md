## Contribution process

### Development

For any changes not related to DPC++, but rather to LLVM in general, it is
strongly encouraged that you submit the patch to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite directly.
See [LLVM contribution guidelines](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html)
for more information.

- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub
  - For the DPC++ end-to-end test development, use **intel** branch as baseline
    for your changes.
- Prepare your patch
  - follow [LLVM coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
  - [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and
    [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) tools can be
    integrated into your workflow to ensure formatting and stylistic
    compliance of your changes.
  - use

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/llvm/sycl/clang/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format
    python git-clang-format `git merge-base origin/intel HEAD`
    ```

    to check the format of your current changes against the `origin/intel`
    branch.
    - `-f` to also correct unstaged changes
    - `--diff` to only print the diff without applying
- Instructions about running DPC++ tests
  - see [README.md](SYCL/README.md).

### Commit message

- When writing your commit message, please make sure to follow
  [LLVM developer policies](
  https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#commit-messages) on the subject.
- For any DPC++-related commit, the `[SYCL]` tag should be present in the
  commit message title. To a reasonable extent, additional tags can be used
  to signify the component changed, e.g.: `[LIT]`, `[NFC]`, `[Doc]`.

### Review and acceptance testing

- Create a pull request for your changes following [Creating a pull request
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
- CI will run checks (e.g. clang-format-check) as soon as the PR is created.
- Once the PR is approved and all checks have passed, the pull request is
ready for merge.

### Merge

Project maintainers merge pull requests using one of the following options:

- [Rebase and merge] The preferable choice for PRs containing a single commit
- [Squash and merge] Used when there are multiple commits in the PR
  - Squashing is done to make sure that the project is buildable on any commit
- [Create a merge commit] Used for LLVM pull-down PRs to preserve hashes of the
commits pulled from the LLVM community repository
